# KawataAdminPanel!
The modern admin panel for osu! private servers Founded by RealistikDash! Modified for use on Kawata.

It uses libraries such as Flask for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

You may notice that some of this code (especially the early one) is not too great. This is because this is a learning trip for me.
I am using a lot of libraries and concepts that are new to me and it's the first time I'm doing them.
This may be reflected in the quality of the code. I will try to fix up or replace some of the old code when I'm satisfied with the feature set.

**I am planning on rewriting this at some point in the future due to me looking back and realising how bad it is...**

This project is now ready to be deployed as a full replacement to RAP(Ripple Admin Panel).
